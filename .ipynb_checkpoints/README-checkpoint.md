# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Specialization - Coursera (Stanford Online)

# Overview

This repository documents my journey through the **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Specialization** on Coursera, offered by Stanford Online and led by Professor Andrew Ng. The specialization focuses on the foundational and advanced concepts in NLP, empowering learners to build real-world NLP models.

# Specialization Breakdown

The NLP Specialization consists of four courses:

1. **Introduction to Natural Language Processing**
2. **Classification and Vector Spaces**
3. **Sequence Models**
4. **Attention Models: Transforming Text with Deep Learning**

Each course dives deep into key areas of NLP and machine learning, covering theoretical and practical aspects.

# Completion

- **Assignments**: All assignments from each course were completed and passed successfully.
- **Certificate**: Received a certificate of completion for the NLP Specialization.
- **Skills Acquired**: Tokenization, word embeddings, machine translation, named entity recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, and transformer-based models such as BERT and GPT.

# Installation

To replicate any of the projects or assignments from the specialization, you can set up your environment using the following instructions:

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the following installed on your machine:

- **Python (3.6 or above)**
- **pip** (Python package manager)

### Required Libraries

Once Python is set up, the following Python libraries are needed for most NLP-related tasks:

   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk spacy tensorflow torch transformers


- **NumPy & Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and preprocessing.
- **NLTK & SpaCy**: For text processing and linguistic features.
- **TensorFlow & PyTorch**: For deep learning models.
- **Transformers**: For using transformer models such as BERT, GPT, and others.

### Additional Tools

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Many assignments are structured as Jupyter notebooks. If you don't have Jupyter installed,      you can add it using:
 
 pip install notebook
   

- **Google Colab**: Some projects benefit from the computing power of Google Colab, which supports GPU usage for deep learning models.

# Challenges

The NLP Specialization posed various challenges that helped solidify my understanding of the subject:

1. **Handling Large Text Corpora**: Working with large datasets presented challenges in memory management and efficient text preprocessing.
2. **Sequence Models and LSTMs**: Understanding the intricacies of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and GRUs required deeper theoretical knowledge.
3. **Transformer Models**: Applying attention mechanisms and using large pre-trained models like BERT and GPT for tasks like translation and question answering required optimization to manage computational resources.
4. **Fine-Tuning Models**: The process of fine-tuning transformer models on custom datasets required overcoming issues related to overfitting and learning rate tuning.

# Future Directions

After completing the specialization, I plan to apply my acquired skills to:

- **Building End-to-End NLP Applications**: Using NLP for real-world applications such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, or chatbots.
- **Working with Transformer Models**: Developing projects based on state-of-the-art transformers like BERT, GPT, and T5 for tasks like summarization and sentiment classification.
- **Exploring Multilingual NLP**: Extending my learning into multilingual NLP models, focusing on applications in languages other than English.
- **Researching in NLP**: Furthering my knowledge in areas such as transfer learning and domain adaptation in NLP.
